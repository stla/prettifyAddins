# prettifyAddins 2.0.0

 Now the package provides some functions to prettify, which return the pretty 
code. The addins just call these functions and render the pretty code in 
RStudio.


# prettifyAddins 1.0.0

* Added non-interactive versions of the addins, thanks to the V8 package.
* The number of spaces for the indentation is now based on the RStudio preference.
* Added a XML/SVG prettifier.
* Added a C/C++/Java prettifier, requiring `clang-format`.
